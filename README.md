## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm ##

Overview:-
This project demonstrates the "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm"using Python.
KNN is a simple and powerful machine learning method used for classification and prediction.

Features:-
- Loads and processes data
- Implements KNN for classification
- Evaluates model performance
- Visualizes results

Requirements:-
Install the required libraries before running the notebook:
bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

How to Use:-
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook KNNAlgorithm.ipynb
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, train the model, and check the results.

Results:-
- The notebook shows accuracy and a confusion matrix.
- Graphs help visualize the model's performance.
